# Student Management System â€“ Automating Admissions and Fee Tracking in Education

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions often rely on manual methods such as spreadsheets or paper records to manage student data, course enrollments, and fee payments.  
This leads to:
- Data duplication and inconsistency  
- Difficulty tracking payments and balances  
- Limited visibility for administrators and finance teams  
- Delays in student registration and communication  

The absence of a centralized, automated system causes inefficiencies in managing student records, calculating fees, and generating reports.
